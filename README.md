# Understanding Student Success: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify key factors influencing student academic performance, specifically exam scores. 
Using advanced data science techniques, we analyze a comprehensive dataset to provide data-driven recommendations for improving student outcomes.

## Key Features

- Thorough data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of multiple predictive models:
  - Stepwise Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost)
- Comparative model evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Data-driven recommendations for educators and policymakers

## Methodology

1. Data Preparation: Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing distributions and relationships
3. Model Development: Training and cross-validating multiple regression models
4. Model Evaluation: Comparing performance using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE
5. Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying key predictors of academic success
6. Insights and Recommendations: Translating findings into actionable strategies

## Key Findings

- Attendance and hours studied are the most significant predictors of exam scores
- Previous academic performance plays a role, especially for high achievers
- Parental involvement and access to resources have varying impacts across different student groups

## Recommendations

The project concludes with targeted recommendations for school administrators, teachers, and parents, focusing on:

- Improving student attendance
- Promoting effective study habits
- Utilizing historical academic performance for early interventions
- Supporting parental involvement
- Optimizing resource allocation

## Technologies Used

- R for data analysis and modeling
- Various R packages including liver, ggplot2, caret, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have R and necessary packages installed
3. Run the R scripts in the provided order
4. Review the generated visualizations and model outputs
